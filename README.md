# Machine-to-Machine-M2M-Communication-Using-ESP8266

Machine to Machine(M2M) Communication is an essential component in many Industrial IoT (IIoT) systems to communicate data in a short-range. Wi-Fi communication (HTTP) between two ESP8266 NodeMCU boards can exchange data without connecting to the internet (you donâ€™t need a router). One ESP8266 as an Access Point (Server) and another ESP8266 as a Station (Client). Then, the server and the client will exchange data (sensor readings) via HTTP requests.
